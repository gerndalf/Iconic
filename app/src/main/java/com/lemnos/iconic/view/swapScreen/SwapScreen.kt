    TODO:
    Make variable to observe selected package
    (This state var will be set when the user presses chevron)

    Display row w/ current icon, an arrow (with question mark),
    then a temp blank icon with question mark

    Display a 'cancel' button to return to list screen

    Display a 'browse' button that will allow the user to select a new image
    Figure out input validation for that shit

    After accepting an image, display that in the row, on the right
    Make the arrow no longer have a question mark

    Also conditionally display the file path in small text above buttons

    Once image is cleared, display a very large 'iconify' button
    This button will then play a short fullscreen animation
    The final frame will be the new icon with a checkmark
    Then the user will be navigated back to the list screen
